# Plan for today
* Go over what [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are
  * git & Github
    * make sure you have made an account on [Github.com](Github.com) (don't need to install `git` today)
    * [Software Carpentry git-novice lesson] (http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
  * [Jekyll Templates](https://jekyllrb.com/) (don't need to install it today)
 
* Build your own webpage from a choice of templates:
  * Personal Website (with a blog)
    * [https://github.com/valentina-s/project-website-template](https://github.com/valentina-s/project-website-template)   
  * Project Website (for collaborative projects)
    * https://github.com/valentina-s/project-website-template
  * Course Website (if you are teaching a class)
